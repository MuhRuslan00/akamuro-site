        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Only persons who are age 18 or older have permission to access our Services. Our Services are not for access by anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us.

      <section>
        <h2>Storage and Deletion</h2>
        <p>AKAMURO stores Personal Data only as long as reasonably necessary to perform its Services, and Personal Data of our Clients' visitors is automatically deleted or anonymized after a certain period of time. When AKAMURO is requested to delete Personal Data prior to such automatic deletion, we follow a process to ensure that legitimate requests are fulfilled. This includes verifying that the requester is the data subject, or, if the request comes from a Client regarding its visitors, we delete Personal Data at the Client's instruction. Since we do not collect personally identifying information from our Clients' visitors unless the information comes directly from the Client's visitor, we may not be able to verify whether we have such data or match the request to a specific Client. When deleting data, the Personal Data is completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. If we have collected Personal Data about you from more than one Client, we will delete all instances of the Personal Data that we have at the time of the request (to the extent that we are able to verify and match such data). However, if you subsequently authorize or visit the same Client or another Client's website or application, we will have processed your Personal Data in relation to such authorization or visit.</p>
